								<h1 style="color:black">About Weibo</h1>
								<p class="about-paddingB" style="color:black">Weibo.com is the most innovative and 
								second largest online job portal in India. Founded in 2008, over the past decade, 
								Weibo.com has become a prominent name in the recruitment industry. 
								The popularity of the portal is evident from the fact that it has crossed the 
								2.5 crore candidate landmark and has more than 3 lakh latest job vacancies from 
								leading companies on the site. 

Weibo.com connects jobseekers and recruiters by accurately matching candidate profiles to the relevant job 
openings through an advanced 2-way matching technology. While most job portals only focus on getting candidates 
the next job, Weibo focuses on the entire career growth of candidates. To this end, Weibo has launched 
Weibo Learning- India’s largest career skills site for working professionals with over 500+ courses & certifications.</p> 

<p style="color:black">As the industry shifts towards mobile, Weibo.com is leading the transition and is the
 fastest growing job portal 
on mobile devices, witnessing a 100% YOY growth in mobile traffic and also offers on-the-go jobs through the 
Weibo Job Search App. 

Weibo works closely to bridge the gap between talent & opportunities and offers end-to-end recruitment solutions. 
Weibo Job Fair brings candidates and top employers under one roof. While Weibo HR Conclave brings top HR leaders to
 share insights on latest trends, innovations & best practices in the HR industry. Weibo also has a large reach 
 through its print product, Weibo Jobs – the
 Tuesday Job supplement of Hindustan Times– making it the only job portal with an integrated print 
 and online offering</p>
